 In this game, you play as Dustin Bones. With limited vision, you try to take out enemies before they get to you. As you fight, you gain experience towards levelling up. Each time you level up, you gain skill points to use in the skill tree. Use your new skills to kill more enemies and get more new skills. Every now and then, an enemy will drop a pun. Try and collect all 66!
